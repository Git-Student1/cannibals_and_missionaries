# About
Solution for the **Cannibals and Missionaries Problem**. 

A problem explanation can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem

The focus lies in the problem solution and NOT the design. (The design could be improved).

Also, I usually enjoy object-oriented programming like enforced in java. Here I tried to work without classes possibly making the code a bit more messy than usually as I am not used to program like that. 

**Why** not use classes? Because it is a good **exercise** for functional programming and working with self-composed objects commonly used in JS.
